# Sentinel Terminal — Security & Safeguards Guide

Allowing an autonomous AI agent to interact with your operating system requires absolute trust, verifiable boundaries, and zero-leakage guarantees. Sentinel implements a comprehensive **Zero-Trust Security Engine** engineered to protect your local environment from accidental destruction, privilege escalation, and prompt injection attacks.

---

## 1. Categorical Policy Engine & Command Safety Guardian (`CommandSafetyGuardian.ts`)

Sentinel evaluates all proposed operations—both interactive terminal keystrokes and autonomous AI tool executions—against a categorical safety policy and a deep AST security engine:

| Policy Tier | Behavior | Example Operations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`SAFE`** | Executes immediately without interruption | Reading system diagnostics, listing files, checking network connections, inspecting ports |
| **`CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`** | Pauses execution and requires explicit interactive user confirmation | Modifying configuration files, creating directories, terminating user applications, running build scripts |
| **`ADMIN_REQUIRED`** | Strictly requires user confirmation and root/sudo password authentication | Installing systemd daemons, modifying `/etc/`, altering network interfaces, kernel driver actions |
| **`PERMANENTLY_REFUSED`** | Hard-blocked at the keyboard and agent loop; Sentinel asserts lack of capability | Root deletion, block device zeroing, partition wipes, permission lockouts, fork bombs, UEFI wipes, glibc sabotage |

### The 8 Catastrophic Threat Vectors

1. **Root Filesystem & Core Hierarchy Destruction**:
   - Matches: `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf /*`, `rm -rf --no-preserve-root /`, `rm -rf /boot`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/lib`, `/bin`, `rm -rf ~`, `rm -rf $HOME`, `find / -delete`.
2. **Raw Disk & Block Device Overwriting**:
   - Matches: `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd*`, `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/nvme*`, direct device redirection `> /dev/sda`, `cat /dev/zero > /dev/nvme0n1`.
3. **Filesystem Formatting & Storage Wiping**:
   - Matches: `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sd*`, `mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/nvme*`, `wipefs -a /dev/sd*`, `blkdiscard /dev/nvme*`.
4. **Permission & Ownership Lockouts**:
   - Matches: `chmod -R 000 /`, `chmod -R 777 /`, `chown -R nobody /`, `chmod -x /bin/chmod`, `chmod -x /lib/ld-linux*`.
5. **Denial-of-Service, Fork Bombs & Kernel Panics**:
   - Matches: `:(){ :|:& };:`, `while true; do bash & done`, `echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger`, `echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger`.
6. **UEFI NVRAM & Firmware Ruin**:
   - Matches: `rm -rf /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/*`, `rm -rf /boot/efi/*`, `efibootmgr -B`.
7. **Critical Package & C Standard Library Sabotage**:
   - Matches: `pacman -Rdd glibc`, `apt-get purge libc6`, `rpm -e --nodeps glibc`, `rm -f /lib64/ld-linux*.so*`.
8. **Host Network Isolation & Obfuscated Pipelines**:
   - Matches: `iptables -F && iptables -P INPUT DROP`, `ip link delete lo`, `curl ... | base64 -d | bash`, `echo <base64> | base64 -d | sh`.

### Capability Refusal & Impact Analysis Architecture

When a blocked command is detected:
1. **Explicit Capability Limitation**: The terminal responds that Sentinel does not have the capability to execute the command:
   ```text
   ✕ Capability Statement: Sentinel does not have the capability to execute '[command]'.
   ```
2. **Consequence & Impact Analysis**: Sentinel explains the exact technical destruction that would occur if the command were executed (e.g. recursive inode deletion, loss of the C standard library, kernel panic, or irrecoverable UEFI NVRAM bricking).
3. **Safe Alternative**: Sentinel suggests safe, non-destructive commands (e.g. `pacman -Sc`, `apt clean`, `ncdu /`).
4. **Dual-Layer Interception**:
   - **Terminal View Interception (`TerminalView.tsx`)**: Intercepts the Enter keypress before the command is written to the PTY. The pending buffer is cleared, and an ANSI refusal banner is output directly to the terminal without invoking the shell.
   - **AI Agent Tool Interception (`ToolExecutor.ts`)**: Evaluates all commands proposed by the LLM or planner before execution. Destructive commands are blocked, returning the refusal and technical consequence back to the agent loop.
5. **Strict No-Emoji Banner Styling**:
   ```text
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ [!] SENTINEL SECURITY GUARDIAN — ACTION PERMANENTLY REFUSED              │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ✕ Capability Statement: Sentinel does not have the capability to execute 'rm -rf /'.
     • Attempted Command : rm -rf /
     • Threat Category   : ROOT_DESTRUCTION (Target: Root Filesystem (/))

   [i] Consequence & Impact Analysis:
     If executed, this command would recursively and permanently delete all files starting from the root directory (/), including the C standard library, shared drivers, running process binaries, and device nodes.
     The Linux kernel would immediately panic, all running applications would crash, and the operating system would be rendered completely and permanently unbootable, necessitating a full drive reformat and OS reinstallation.

   [+] Safe Alternative:
     To safely clean disk space, remove cached packages with your package manager (e.g. pacman -Sc or apt clean), or inspect disk usage with: ncdu /

   [#] Policy: Sentinel strictly refuses all commands that cause irreversible destruction of the host OS.
   ```

## 2. Asynchronous Non-Blocking Consent Queue (`ConsentQueue.ts`)

- **Tab-Scoped Approvals**: When a tool action requires authorization, the request is dispatched to an asynchronous consent queue tagged with the initiating session/tab ID.
- **Non-Blocking UI**: Background terminal processes continue operating while the security modal awaits user decision.
- **Detailed Action Preview**: The authorization modal presents a transparent diff of proposed shell commands, targeted filesystem paths, and potential system impacts before the user clicks **Approve** or **Deny**.

---

## 3. AST Shell Validation (`ShellAstParser.ts`)

- **Pre-Execution Syntax Analysis**: Model-generated shell commands are parsed by a dedicated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) engine prior to execution.
- **Subshell & Obfuscation Detection**: Automatically flags hidden command chaining, subshell injection (`` `...` ``, `$(...)`), and pipe-to-interpreter patterns (`curl ... | bash`).
- **Path Confinement**: Ensures file mutations stay confined to authorized workspace directories.

---

## 4. Prompt Injection Defense & Data Protection

- **Delimited Tool Observations**: Tool outputs fed back into the LLM context window are strictly wrapped in distinct XML-style boundary delimiters (`<tool_output>...</tool_output>`). This prevents untrusted external data (such as malicious README files or web scrape contents) from hijacking model instructions.
- **Automated Secret Redaction (`SecretRedactor.ts`)**: Scans all command arguments, environment outputs, and execution logs for API keys, AWS credentials, private SSH keys, and password patterns, replacing them with `[REDACTED]` before writing to disk.
- **Local Sovereignty**: All reasoning occurs within the local embedded `llama-server` in machine RAM. Zero keystrokes, source code snippets, or environment variables ever leave your machine.

---

## 5. Session Undo Log & Destructive Rollback (`UndoLog.ts`)

- **Transactional Action Tracking**: Reversible actions (file edits, branch creation, package installations) are recorded in an in-memory session undo log.
- **Action Inspection**: Ask `>what did you just do` at any time to receive a transparent summary of recently performed modifications.
- **One-Command Rollback**: Ask `>undo last step` to trigger deterministic compensation actions (restoring pre-modification `.bak` file snapshots, reverting git stashes, or untrashing deleted files).

---

## 6. Immutable Audit Trails & Benchmark Isolation

- **Production Audit Logging**: Every capability invocation, parameter payload, policy tier evaluation, and completion timestamp is recorded to `~/.sentinel/audit.jsonl`.
- **Benchmark Isolation**: Test harnesses and automated benchmarks write exclusively to isolated logs (`~/.sentinel/audit.benchmark.jsonl`), ensuring production development records remain unpolluted.
- **Binary & Model Integrity**: Downloads for embedded binaries (`llama-server`) and GGUF models are verified against SHA-256 cryptographic checksums before loading into memory.
